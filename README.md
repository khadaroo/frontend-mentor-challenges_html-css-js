### What I learned

This project helped me practice advanced CSS Grid layouts and responsive design. I learned how to use `grid-template-areas` for complex layouts and how to combine CSS custom properties for consistent theming.

```css
.testimonial {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "one"
    "two"
    "three"
    "four"
    "five";
  /* ... */
}
```

I also improved my skills in structuring semantic HTML and using BEM-style class naming for maintainable CSS.
